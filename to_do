(switch to multi-processing library)
(save replay_memory either at the end or after many iterations)
(kalman filter on visual goal)
(collision avoidance when using 2 arms)
(fix normalization of angles)

final report:
- sections for: vision, real robot & two arms
	- vision (Bo)
	- 2 arms: just trained a right arm network + splitted workspace into 2 parts (if goal close to right/left shoulder, move corresponding arm in order to avoid collisions)

- all milestones (all completed, even triangle) + explanation/description of 3-4 lines each (phenomena, observations, achievements, failures?)

- technical details:
	- especially algorithm + modifications (e.g. sampling, exploration, ...)
	- simulations environment (images, workflow)
	- robot + environment modeling
	- from simulation to real robot (problems, changes)

- personal feedback (new knowledge): 
	- project management, 
	- numerical issues of simulations, 
	- descritization of 1 degree shows trade-off between achieving the goal of reaching task + using discrete actions 
- reflexion about project (how would you change the project, improvements?, sugestions to next years student)
	- nothing to change, we even reached optional goals like vision + drawing of triangle (maybe screenshot)

IMPORTANT:
experience + personal feedback
experiments showed that exploration successful (because problems were forseen)
